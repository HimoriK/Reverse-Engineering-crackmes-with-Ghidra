## Solution

The author of this crackme says that is very simple one to solve, but first we have to run it and look at its "exterior". Let's see what do we have here!

As author mentioned in the description this crackme accepts **only numbers**. So we have 1 solid clue in our search for the key. Let's open the Code Browser and see what's under the hood of this crackme!

First we need to import the file to our project and then start the analyze process. Just use the default options to run the analysis.

Step 1:

And we finally opened the file in a Code Browser where all magic happens! I hope you've already watched the great Ghidra introduction video I've mentioned on the main page of this tutorial series, so we may consider that you are already familiar with the Ghidra UI.

As we've discovered the crackme has it's own classic "Please enter the password... blah blah" procedure as well as the error output with the furious notification that the password you've entered is wrong. So if we know what the phrase the machine gives us when we do something wrong, we can definitely find the phrase when the password is correct.

Our next step is to find a string the crackme outputs in case we feed it with a valid password. This time we use string search and filter.
Open "**Search**" --> "**For Strings...**"

Then use filter to find a word in the asswembly code that associate with a password we need. For example we take "correct" as a bait =)

Indeed this is a good start! We found a whole program notiofication that the password we entered is a valid one. Ghidra says that it's location is **```0040213c```**. Double click to go to its position in assembly code.

As you dear reader already know everything the program does, buzzes, whispers, - all of it has its own interpretation in terms of programming code. We just need to find that code. And Ghidra helps us! You see the XREF marker? It's a key to our solution: reference to the function **```FUN_00401080```** which contains code that prints out the phrase about correct password.

Click the XREF marker twice after you hover it:

And there it is. The middle window shows you the **ASSEMBLY CODE** of the core function that does all the work of calculating the correctness of the password you enter. Right window is the **DECOMPILER WINDOW**, it shows the decompiled C code produced by Ghidra. And the decompiled source code contains all we need to solve this crackme.

Just look at the code. What do we see here?

<img src = "https://github.com/Marco888Space/Reverse-Engineering-crackmes-with-Ghidra/blob/main/solutions/crackme_1/12.PNG">

We can already divide code into 3 parts:
1. Lines [5-10] - variables declaration
2. Lines [12-14] - Text output & text input section
3. Line 15 - **if** comparison of variable and some value(!)
4. Lines [16-22] - if comparison returns **TRUE**
5. Lines [24-30] - if comparison returns **FALSE**

For the purpose of curiuosity we can see that **FUN_00401020** and **FUN_00401050** are functions that call printf() and scanf() inside them respectively. Have a look at assembly and C code of these two fellows:

=== **Decompiled C code** ===

**FUN_00401020**:

<img src = "https://github.com/Marco888Space/Reverse-Engineering-crackmes-with-Ghidra/blob/main/solutions/crackme_1/13.PNG">

**FUN_00401050**:

<img src = "https://github.com/Marco888Space/Reverse-Engineering-crackmes-with-Ghidra/blob/main/solutions/crackme_1/14.PNG">

=== **Assembly code** ===

**FUN_00401020**:

<img src = "https://github.com/Marco888Space/Reverse-Engineering-crackmes-with-Ghidra/blob/main/solutions/crackme_1/15.PNG">

**FUN_00401050**:

<img src = "https://github.com/Marco888Space/Reverse-Engineering-crackmes-with-Ghidra/blob/main/solutions/crackme_1/16.PNG">

Also, do you notice that **printf()** and **scanf()** are called as pointers to external functions:

**FUN_00401020**:

<img src = "https://github.com/Marco888Space/Reverse-Engineering-crackmes-with-Ghidra/blob/main/solutions/crackme_1/17.PNG">

**FUN_00401050**:

<img src = "https://github.com/Marco888Space/Reverse-Engineering-crackmes-with-Ghidra/blob/main/solutions/crackme_1/18.PNG">

It is time to move back to our main() function.
We know that our input value is written to **stack0xfffffff4** which has **int** type. At first we see that **printf()** function is called (**```FUN_00401020```**) which displays the welcoming words of program. In assembler it has ```CALL FUN_00401020``` instruction. Then ```CALL FUN_00401050``` is called, which is **scanf()** that writes the input value to **stack0xfffffff4**. And only then we see the main magic trick: the comparison of **stack0xfffffff4** value to some... key maybe? If we hover over the **0x11ca423e** value (the unknown entity whic is compared to our input value) we get an information pop-up which gives us the decimal value of this strange sequence: **298467902** (we can also get decimal convertation by just clicking the right mouse button on the value). 

In assembly window we see what happens:

```CMP``` intruction compares the strange key with our input value by accesing it through pointer ```**dword ptr [EBP + local_c]**```. Next we have this:

```JNZ``` instruction validates if the **ZERO flag** was set to 0 or 1: if **1** (comparison returns FALSE) it JUMPS to ```LAB_004010eb``` section where **printf()** displays "Wrong key!" string, if ZERO flag is set **0** (zero difference between comparable values, comparison returns true and values are equal) then **printf()** function is called which notifies that we've found the correct password (block of decompiled code 16-22 is executed). Let's try the strange key that we've found:

YES! It is indeed the valid password. The victory is finally ours!
